This is a fork of the [ODK Collect app](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect) and thus should be regularly updated and tested when the ODK Collect app is updated.

Currently, the operators use the [regular ODK Collect app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en) rather than this fork. However, with a fork, we could make installation simpler, eliminate some of the unneccessary options and automatically update the forms on the operators' local device.
